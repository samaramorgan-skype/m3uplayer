# Overview:

IPTV is a new method of delivering and viewing television programs using an IP network and high speed broadband technology. It is fast becoming a popular value added service in many countries. 
However in India, IPTV is yet to be a big thing.

As per TRAI Regulations,
New Delhi, 4th January, 2008 â€“ Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) releases the recommendation on provisioning of IPTV services. 

IPTV is legal in India but it not yet provisioned by government.

So, I am making a concept of IPTV service.
Collecting some m3u8 sources of free 2 air TV Channels.
Creating a basic Bootstrap based Web page that handles the URLs from the m3u Playlist And Chromecast based addon player to play those livestreams in browser.
